This directory contains the SAX sample program from the XMLAda docs. It illustrates a very
simple SAX style pass over an XML file. To try this example you need to

1. Install XMLAda at some suitable location. This entails compiling XMLAda from source according
   to the XMLAda documentation, etc.

2. Add the directory were the xmlada.gpr project file is located to your ADA_PROJECT_PATH
   environment variable. Note that this project file is in the lib\gnat directory in the
   installed XMLAda system.

After these steps, the sample program can be built in GPS and run from the command line.

Enjoy!
